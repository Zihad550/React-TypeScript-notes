# Note-6

## use Type on useState hooks

- Most of the time we don't have to explicitly set the use state value type. TypeScript automatically sets the value type. **Loggedin.tsx** for example.

- To use type on useState hook see user.tsx
- You only use when the initial value type is different compared with future value type.
